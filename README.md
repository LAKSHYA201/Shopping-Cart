# Shopping-Cart
A ReactJS based Shopping Cart , with basic funcitonalities of Home page , A shop page where you can add items to your cart , and a cart page to view your added items , an icon in the navigation keeps updating the number of items in the cart .
I have used react routers , Outlets , Outlet Contexts , PropTypes Validations , uuid v4 for secure key generation for cart items , useNavigate .
I might write tests for this application using Vitest , when i am done watching The Peacemaker , :)
